		JDBC

Q. What are the differences between Statement and PreparedStatement?
A.Prepared statement preserves parsed queries and resues the same query with different parameters whereas Statement queries are parsed in every database call.

Q. Why and when PreparedStaement is used?
A. When the same query is fired multiple times with different parameters.

Q. What is a transaction and how you can handle transactions in JDBC?
A. A transaction is a set of SQL statement or a unit of work that will be commited and rollback together. Transaction are handled with the help of connection.setAutoCommit(false), connection.commit() and connection.rollback() method.

Q. What is a commit and rollback in a transaction?
A. If explicitly commit of all sql statement. If sql exception will be occur then transaction will be rollback.

Q. What is a stored procedure and how you can call it from JDBC?
A. Stored Procedure is collection of sql statement which compiled & stored in database. call -> Connection.prepareCall().   OR
   create procedure inside the database. It call with Callable Statement.

Q. What are IN, OUT, and INOUT arguments of CallableStatement?
A. IN - These parameters are used to send parameter value to stored function or procedure.
   OUT - These parameters are used to receive values from stored function or procedure.
   INOUT - These parameters are used to send or receive values from stored function and procedure.

Q. How you can retrieve multiple ResultSets from CallableStatement?
A. ResultSet.getResultSets().

Q. How you can retrieve a String return value from CallableStatement?
A. rs.getString().

Q. Describe URL in DriverManager.getConnection(url, "myLogin", "myPassword") command.
A. 

Q. What is MetaData and how you can get it?
A. MetaData is data about database. We can get it by rs.getMetaData().

Q. What are the differences between java.sql.Date and java.sql.Timestamp data type?
A. 

Q. How many types of drivers in JDBC?
A. There are 4 types of driver.
   1. JDBC-ODBC Bridge Driver.
   2. Native Driver
   3. Middleware Driver
   4. Pure Java Driver

Q. Which type of driver have you used in JDBC?
A. Pure Java Driver

Q. Where do you find concrete classes of Statement and Prepared Statement? 
A. Java.SQL Package.

Q. What is a Data connection pool?
A. DCP is a pool of connection. It is created at the application startUp.    OR
   Application is concurrently accessed by multiple users to access and manipulate database record.

Q. What are the advantages of a database connection pool?
A. 1. High Performance. 2. It controls number of connection created. 3. It allows application to handle more concurrent users.
   Connection resuability and limit of maximum connection are provided by Data Connection Pool.

Q. What is a Database connection pool? How do you configure database connection pool in a web application (web.xml), hibernate, WebLogic?
A. Configure DCP "datasource" tag in web.xml.

Q. If an application is connected with 4 databases then how many database connection pools are expected?
A. 

Q. How JDBC is following Bridge Design Pattern? How did you create NBPK in your application?
A. Because JDBC is a set of interface like Connection, ResultSet, Statement etc. and we will find their implementation classes in a driver jar file(mySQLConnector.jar).
   1. DriverManager.getConnection() follows factory design patterns 
   2. Connection, ResultSet, Statement etc. have different implementations so follow bridge design patterns

Q. What is NBPK?
A. It is an auto-increment integer column. It does not have any business value and selected for the primary key.

Q. How did you create NBPK in your application?
A. We have added an auto-increment integer column in every table of our database and made it a primary key.

Q. What is the advantage of NBPK?
A. 1. It can offer better performance.   
   2. It help in maintain data integrity.
   3. It adds in database normalization. 
   4. It can simplify structure of database.

Q. What is the disadvantage of Business Primary Key?
A. Business Primary key can be changed in the future. If you change primary key and foreign key will become invalid, and produce disintegrated data.

Q. What is normalization?
A. Achieve atomic column, primary key, and removing data redundancy is called normalization.

Q. How many types of normalization forms are available?
A. There are  3 Normalization Forms and the rest are Boyce and Codd Normalization rules.
   a. 1NF - Each column in a table must have atomic values.  Atomic value can not be divided.
   b. 2NF - Each Table should have Primary Key
   c. 3NF- Data redundancy should be removed with help of Primary Key and Foreign Key
   d. Boyce and Codd Normal Form (BCNF)

Q. What is the atomic value?
A. A value like an atom that can not be further divided. like "name" can be divided into "first name" and "last name" but "first name" can not be divided further. 
   Or address can be divided into address, city, state, country.

Q. What is De-normalization?When do you use de-normalization?
A. When we deviate from normalization and duplicate the data in multiple table then it is de-normalization.

Q. When do you use de-normalization?
A. For optimizing time-critical report performance de-normalization is used. It will increase the report response time.

Q. Why does de-normalization save time?
A. Since tables have dependent duplicate data, getting data from table reduces join queries.

Q. How do you call Stored Procedure and Function from JDBC?
A. We execute it using CallableStatement.

Q. What is the function of registerOutParameter() method in CallableStatement?
A. Registers the OUT parameter with the specified name to the given JDBC type and type name.

Q. What is the disadvantage of Stored Procedure and Functions?
A. It will make Application Database Dependent.

Q. When do you use Stored Procedure and Function in your application?
A. It is used for reporting purposes.  Sometimes Reports need high performance so we write Stored Procedure/Function to created reports.

Q. What is the Database connection pool?
A. Application is concurrently accessed by multiple users to access and manipulate database record.

Q. How do you configure the database connection pool in a web application?
A. We will configure DCP as a "datasource" tag in web.xml file.

Q. Can you configure DCP in the Desktop application?
A. Yes, we can configure using DCP open source API.

Q. How many DCP will be created for a Database?
A. One DCP for One Database

Q. Which library you have used to create a data connection pool?
A. C3P0

Q. Which library jars you have used for DCP?
A. C3P0-0.9.2.1.jar , mchange-commons-java-0.2.3.4.jar

Q. Which DCP will you use in SpringBoot?
A. Hikari

Q. Can you make an application without using DCP?
A. No, production application can not be made without DCP.

Q. Exception handle in mysql.
A. 1. MySql - Declare Handler   Declare Continue    Declare Exit.
   2. Oracle - Use Exception Block
   3. MySql Server - Try Catch block
